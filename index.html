					<h3>Welcome</h3>
					<br>
					<p>Currently, I am a fellow at <a href="http://insightdatascience.com/">Insight Data Science</a>. I recently graduated with my PhD from the University of California, Berkeley in Mechanical Enginering. My research is at the intersection of applied mathematics and energy. I study statistics, optimization, and machine learning to improve energy generation and efficiency. I earned a BASci in Engineering Science, majoring in Energy Systems from the University of Toronto, and a MS in Mechanical Engineering from UC Berkeley.</p>
					<br>
					<p>Most recently, I developed a deep learning solution for the computer vision problem of image segmentation on overlapping DNA chromosomes. You can read about it <a href="https://blog.insightdatascience.com/separating-overlapping-chromosomes-with-deep-learning-based-image-segmentation-22f97afd3283">here</a></p>
